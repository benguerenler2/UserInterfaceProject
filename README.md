The Flying Dutchman is a franchising group with a small local pub here in Downsala with an increasing number of recurring visitors. Since the pub has a tradition of providing a "family" feeling among its customers, the long queues at the bar desk have become slightly annoying if not to the customers, so at least to bar owners and staff.

It is also time to start modernizing the bar somewhat, still without changing the traditional air of the pub. One part is to support the bartender with a new ordering system, and the other is to use small touch screens distributed in the pub area, where the customers can select their beer of choice in their own pace. Also included are some ideas about providing certain special information about the beers, such as if they contain gluten or not. 

During the planning of the new system, the bar owners suddenly had the (maybe not completely legal, but still) idea of having a set of VIP customers, who have a certain credit at the bar, and who can be trusted to handle their own serving of the beers from the VIP cooler (which is close to the bar disk). The idea started with Uncle Jordan, who is a very close friend of the pub owner, who already goes behind the bar and picks up his beer with a wave to the bartender. 

So, the final idea behind the project is to build a system that will support the bartenders, allow the customers to choose the beer at the table, and for VIP customers to also be able to order and pay a beer through the system.
